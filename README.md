ProyectoOperativosBMWBaladiInvernon

This is a project to an Operative Systems course at Universidad Metropolitana to evaluate the use of threads and semaphores.
It's a cars factory simulator, there are many producers and each one is a thread and they need to wait for the depot to let their production.
